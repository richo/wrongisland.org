And if you click on the [schedule][schedule] button, you can read it!

Some housekeeping to go along with this post;

## Pricing

As a few have been quick to point out, I stupidly managed to put the tickets up
in AUD instead of NZD like you would expect. As a result you've all been
charged somewhere in the ballpark of $53-$56 depending on what the exchange
rate was doing at the time.

We're really sorry about that! It was an honest mistake, but the only way to
fix it directly was to refund every ticket and then hassle people into rebuying
them after changing it.

As a token of gratitude, I've thrown $5 * $badges_sold on top of what was
already going on the tab.
