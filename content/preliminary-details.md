Title: Preliminary Details
Date: 2016-06-17 20:09

We're just about 6 weeks out from the con, and we're stoked to see all of you real soon.

We're also excited to release some of the details:

## Afterparty

Will be in longbeach. The exact location is tbd, but a [convenient ferry][ferry]
can get you as far as longbeach. It'll be within walking distance of the ferry.

## Sponsors

We're still looking for sponsors, if you or your company is interested you can
find the details [over here][cfs]

We are **thrilled** to announce the support of [threatbutt][threatbutt], the
leaders in viking grade protection for advanced APT threats.

If you're in a position where you'd love to come to the con, but can't afford
to, reach out. Threatbutt has sponsored some tickets.

We're also stoked to announce the support of [ICE9 Consulting](http://ice9.us),
an extremely serious firm of bluetooth experts who're sponsoring the badges
(Spoilers: they're fucking awesome).

## Speakers!

The first round of speakers are announced:

### Abhijeth Dugginapeddi

    Can you copy and paste from Stackoverflow? I would love to pwn you

### Michael Ossmann

    Whole Packet Clock Recovery

### nico

    Walking tour of L-band satellite communications

## Papers

Despite a bunch of great submissions, the CFP is still open! We'd love to have
your talk as well; the details are still up on [the cfp page][cfp].

And finally

## Tickets

There are still a ton of tickets available. We're putting together something
pretty special, so if you haven't already come and [grab one][tickets].

The deadline for the badge and tshirt order is rapidly coming up, so while
we'll sell tickets till we either sell out, or the day of the con, if you don't
get in soon you migth wind up without a badge or a tshirt, and that'd be a
goddamn tragedy.
