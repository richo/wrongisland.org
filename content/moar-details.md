Title: Moar Details
Date: 2016-06-24 20:09

We're just about 6 weeks out from the con, and we're stoked to see all of you real soon.

We're also excited to release some of the details:

## Afterparty

Will be at [Federal Bar][federalbar] in longbeach! It's a pretty chill spot,
and is a short convenient walk from the Ferry. Can't wait to see you all there.

## Sponsors

Woo more sponsors!

[Mercury ISS][mercury] has stepped up as well as a sponsor. So a massive thanks goes out to them.

The tshirt order is going in **very** soon, but we still have a slot for one
more sponsor. So if you want that to be you, and you want your logo on the
shirt, you should get in touch real soon.

## Speakers!

Stoked to announce some more speakers!

### Collin Mulliner

    Sömething sömething möbile research

### Mike Ryan

    Memory Corruption bugs in classic zelda games

## Papers

Despite a bunch of great submissions, the CFP is still open! We'd love to have
your talk as well; the details are still up on [the cfp page][cfp].

And finally

## Tickets

There are still a ton of tickets available. We're putting together something
pretty special, so if you haven't already come and [grab one][tickets].

The deadline for the badge and tshirt order is rapidly coming up, so while
we'll sell tickets till we either sell out, or the day of the con, if you don't
get in soon you migth wind up without a badge or a tshirt, and that'd be a
goddamn tragedy.
