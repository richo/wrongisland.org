The CFP is open!

We'd love to have your short (15-20 minute) lightning talk on something
interesting and nominally computer security related. Leave out the context, we
want to see your One Weird Trick. Background is best discussed over beers
afterward where you can work out how much you want to frieNDA this chump in
anyway.

Please send through:

* Handle:
* Talk Title:
* Brief overview:
* Bio:

To richo@psych0tik.net

I'm also suitably convinced that this thing will happen that I'm looking for
ONE (1) ((11!1!!!)) sponsor. If this sounds interesting to you, get in touch to
discuss terms.

Till NZ,

richo
