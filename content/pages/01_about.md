In the beginning, there were three aircraft destined for New Zealand. And they
were righteous. And they were full of goddamn nerds. They embarked from Sydney,
from Melbourne, and from Brisbane.

But the weather gods took offense to our plight, and with great fury and wrath
did drape a blanket of thickest fog across Wellington, seeking to confuse and
disorient us.

When finally our noble steeds' stamina was depleted, our noble captains
directed us to the nearest port, to Christchurch, and while repairs were made,
we used our pocket telephones to congregate. And lo, it was declared: "Fuck it,
we'll have wrong island con in the airport".

In a crushing tale of woe and sorrow, our captors had considered with the
weather gods, and saught to constrain us. And constrain us they did, because
they threatened to not take us to Wellington.

One year has passed since that solemn day, and this time nothing will stop us.
