Wrong Island Con is a security conference borne of an unfortunate incident
involving 3 planes full of nerds trying to get to Kiwicon from Australia.

The flights were redirected to Christchurch by bad weather in Wellington, which
caused more than a couple of people to ask them to "Let us off the damn plane,
we'll have WrongIslandCon". Unfortunately, they wouldn't, but the idea grabbed
some traction and in 2014 the first Wrong Island Con took place in
Christchurch.

Wrong Island Con is a little different than a lot of security conferences.
Instead of long speaking slots with lightning talks supporting, the *only*
speaking slots at WIC are 20 minute talks. The goal is to make the format both
more approachable, and significantly more interesting.

By having shorter slots, we can accept research that's potentially nicher or
more esoteric, and both expose people to techniques they wouldn't ordinarily
see.
