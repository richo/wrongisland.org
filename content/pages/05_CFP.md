There's not currently a cfp open BUT THERE'S A RUMOUR ONE MIGHT OPEN AT SOME
POINT.

## A note about speaking

Wrong Island has an "everyone pays" policy, not dissimilar from PyCon's. The
intent here is to level the playing field a bit and do away with some of the
mightier than thou aspects of a lot of hacker cons. This also has a lot to do
with the fact that as a tiny con in it's first year, we can't afford to pay for
flights or accommodation either.

That said, if you want to come and can't put together the money, submit a talk
and explain the situation. We can probably work something out.

If you're unsure whether or not it's worth your time to give a talk since we're
not even going to spot you a badge, we will be finding other ways to compensate
speakers.
