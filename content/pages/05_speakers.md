So far, the lineup is:

## Peter Fillmore: Controlling a $20 RC car with a $420 SDR

Hey, we’ve all bought this awesome hackrf - so lets play with it - literally.
This talk will cover how to control a cheap 27MHz RC car using your expensive
software defined radio.  Its kinda like using a Ferrari to tow a trailer.
I’ll go through how the car is controlled through RF and what gnuradio blocks
are used to create the same signals.  Hopefully you’ll glean some information
that can be used on something actually useful.

Peter is a jerk who made a computer make music then made another bunch of
computers play it for a profit.
He also made managers at banks and credit card companies angry this year.
You can ask him questions that he can’t answer due to the many numerous NDAs he
has to sign to work in this field.  Also, trust him, he’s a CISSP…

## Mike Ryan: Hacking bluetooth keyboards

Mike will demo some exploitation techniques against bluetooth HID devices.
In his words: 20 minutes later the crowd goes "fuck"

mike ryan is a computer jerk from california who actually does this crap for a living.

## AmmonRa: Liberating my bio-data

The Basis bio-metric watch is quite a cool piece of hardware. Sadly the
developers decided to not let users access their own data, which must be
uploaded to a cloud server. Even then you can only see a high level view, no
access to raw data. This talk will explain how I reversed engineered the
android app and built my own, and how I decoded the raw data.

AmmonRa is a hacker and cyborg, originally from the very town in which Wrong
Island Con is held, he has been exiled to Melbourne after a hacking incident
with the local council.
