## Peter Fillmore: Controlling a $20 RC car with a $420 SDR

Hey, we’ve all bought this awesome hackrf - so lets play with it - literally.
This talk will cover how to control a cheap 27MHz RC car using your expensive
software defined radio.  Its kinda like using a Ferrari to tow a trailer.
I’ll go through how the car is controlled through RF and what gnuradio blocks
are used to create the same signals.  Hopefully you’ll glean some information
that can be used on something actually useful.

Peter is a jerk who made a computer make music then made another bunch of
computers play it for a profit.
He also made managers at banks and credit card companies angry this year.
You can ask him questions that he can’t answer due to the many numerous NDAs he
has to sign to work in this field.  Also, trust him, he’s a CISSP…

## Mike Ryan: Hacking bluetooth keyboards

Mike will demo some exploitation techniques against bluetooth HID devices.
In his words: 20 minutes later the crowd goes "fuck"

mike ryan is a computer jerk from california who actually does this crap for a living.

## AmmonRa: Liberating my bio-data

The Basis bio-metric watch is quite a cool piece of hardware. Sadly the
developers decided to not let users access their own data, which must be
uploaded to a cloud server. Even then you can only see a high level view, no
access to raw data. This talk will explain how I reversed engineered the
android app and built my own, and how I decoded the raw data.

AmmonRa is a hacker and cyborg, originally from the very town in which Wrong
Island Con is held, he has been exiled to Melbourne after a hacking incident
with the local council.

## Rich 'iodboi' Smith: TR-069: Your spec is bad and you should feel bad......

TR-069 is a spec that is widely used in SOHO broadband equipment from ISP's to
provide remote access to devices and the networks lying behind them, yet is one
that few people have really heard of or played with. The talk will jump
headlong into pulling apart a poorly defined spec and the attack opportunities
it provides against large customer bases.

Rich is the Director of Security at Etsy where he leads the fearless band of
cyber-guardians that defend Etsy's members, sellers and knitted good from the
evils of the Interwebs - Cross-site-stitching and sequin-injection are all
taken in stride daily. Before Etsy Rich spent the previous 10 years focussed
offensive R&D and consulting and holding positions at a variety of companies
including Immunity Inc., Kyrus Technology and HP Labs culminating in the
co-founding of a research focussed consultancy called Syndis in Iceland. In his
spare time Rich like beer, noisy music and Python.

## Snare: Fiddling with EFI

Snare is going to wander through the ins and outs of capturing and reverse
engineering EFI firmware. This will likely include live demos of 3rd party and
homegrown tooling, and some real world examples of the underlying tech. In
truth he didn't send in an abstract so who actually knows.

The scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia. Named after an OK drink at a
Melbourne bar, snare's hugs are internationally famous. He does computer stuff
as a thin guise for hug distribution.

<a name="bushax"></a>
## rzn (@\_rezin\_): Bus-master Baiting

After giving a failed talk at kiwicon last year involving DMA attacks using an
FPGA development board and an aggressively recalled Bplus TH05 Thunderbolt to
PCIe adapter, rzn will go over some new devices released since then that are
more freely available, cheaper and easier to use that will let you bus-master
bait till you can't bus-master bait no more.

rzn is a PhD student desperately trying to escape to the real world where
people earn money and wear shoes.

## Neal 'y011' Wise: UNIX Without Too Many Traces*

This brief talk covers methods you can use to interactively access UNIX-like
systems with minimal event generation.  This is a secondary 'attack' occurring
after you've achieved some other method of access (which will also be
summarised). The discussion will be a summary of common UNIX event capture
facilities, their behaviour and limitations. Sometimes it's useful to hide your
actions... sometimes it's just a fun way to access systems and annoy other
users who don't realise you're there.

Neal Wise ( @y011 [that's with a zero, yo]) runs @assurance and rocks the -vvv

## Matthew 'mjg59' Garrett: "I did not send richo a title"

Firmware boots your system. It's your root of trust. And it's shit.
Impressively so. Find out how, and how people are making it better

Matthew has a 28.8bps modem and a killer refresh rate

<a name="usbhax"></a>
## Dominic Spill: USBProxy

A USBProxy thing.  Dominic will do something new and yet mildly useless with
USBProxy.

If Dominic has one ability it's feeling crappy at cons.  If he has more than
on, computering is somewhere on the list.

<a name="boothax"></a>
## Kaan Kivilcim: When full is only 99.9% full.

A tale about one day worth of effort (maybe two by the time the con comes
around) looking at Linux's /boot partition. It wasn't what I expected and
there's some fun to be had.

ls wasn't creative enough to be a web developer. He also wasn't evil enough to
work with baby killers forever. So now he's content just hoarding everyone's
data for the foreseeable future.
