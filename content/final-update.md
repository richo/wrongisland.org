Title: Final Update
Date: 2016-07-27 16:35

Weeeeeee. We're like.. terrifyingly close to the con. I can't wait to see all of you.

I have some updates!

## Travel

So, it turns out I might have been naive in suspecting that we could just get
away with yolo'ing the ferry. If you have not already bought tickets, I would
definitely recommend doing that. The con's still slated to start at 10, but if
we get obviously delayed by ferries we'll hold off till we at least have a
quorum present.

Once you've made it onto the island, it's a short 10-15 minute walk up to
outlook hall. We're planning to start around 10am.

## Sponsor

I've been super remiss in not mentioning that we picked up a sponsor last week.

[Great Scott Gadgets][gsg] are picking up the tab for lunch and feeding everyone. Yay food!
