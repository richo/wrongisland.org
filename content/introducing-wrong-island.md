Wrong Island Con: It is happening.

Born of a bunch of Australin infosec jerks getting sent to the Wrong Island on our pilgrimage to kiwicon 7 last year, we figured we'd probably best head to the wrong island for a couple of days to warm up for kiwicon proper. Should you join us? Yes you should.

- Where? The Twisted Hop.
- - 617 Ferry Road, Woolston, Christchurch 8023

- When? Monday, Dec 8

- What? Some lightning talks. Some hanging out. Think barcon meets PoC||GTFO.

- Why? Stop asking questions. Come.

You can find more things about the con on [the twitter][twitter]. I'll put up the eventbrite thing soon.

Till NZ, peace.
