Title: WIC is a thing that happened
Date: 2015-02-26 22:44

So Wrong Island Con took place, and was allegedly a pretty good time. Thank you
all so much to the jerks that came and made it awesome!

In particular, a huge shoutout to [insomnia][insomnia], [great scott gadgets][gsg],
and [hackerone][h1] who legendarily came out of the woodwork as sponsors on the
day. On behalf of everyone who drank delicious beers and ate delicious foods,
cheers!

I'm acutely aware that I still need to ship a bunch of you tshirts. Rest
assured that they sit safely in my loungeroom, waiting for my anxiety about
shipping stuff to back off. I haven't forgotten you.

Thinking forward, a bunch of people have asked me about a second Wrong Island
Con. I'm blown away by the responses, and the sheer number of offers for help
that I've had. I'm still very much in the midst of trying hard not to think
about, however plans are afoot, and there's a pretty good chance this will
happen again. More details will probably pop up here or [on
tooter][twitteraccount] as we get closer to my vaguely specified date.
