Title: speakers nearly full!
Date: 2014-11-19 08:44

With 10 announced speakers, we're nearly full!

There's still room for 2 more slots, so if you're sitting on a CFP submission
you should get it to us ASAP.

The schedule will be published in the next few days. Getting some more
logistics out of the way:

## Accommadation

There's a fairly cheap Rydges about a 5 minute cab ride away. Unfortunately we
didn't quality for a group rate, but you can make a booking [here][rydges_booking].


## Afterparty

After the con finishes up, there'll be a tab downstairs at the 'Hop. We hope
you'll join us for a few quiet beverages.

As the last few details are firmed up in the next few days we'll be publishing
the final schedule.

See you at the con!
