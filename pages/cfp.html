    <p>There's not currently a cfp open BUT THERE'S A RUMOUR ONE MIGHT OPEN AT SOME
POINT.</p>
<h2>A note about speaking</h2>
<p>Wrong Island has an "everyone pays" policy, not dissimilar from PyCon's. The
intent here is to level the playing field a bit and do away with some of the
mightier than thou aspects of a lot of hacker cons. This also has a lot to do
with the fact that as a tiny con in it's first year, we can't afford to pay for
flights or accommodation either.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to come and can't put together the money, submit a talk
and explain the situation. We can probably work something out.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether or not it's worth your time to give a talk since we're
not even going to spot you a badge, we will be finding other ways to compensate
speakers.</p>
