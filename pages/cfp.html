    <p>We'd love to have your short (15-20 minute) lightning talk on something
interesting and nominally computer security related. Leave out the context, we
want to see your One Weird Trick. Background is best discussed over beers
afterward where you can work out how much you want to frieNDA this chump in
anyway.</p>
<p>Please send through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle:</li>
<li>Talk Title:</li>
<li>Brief overview:</li>
<li>Bio:</li>
</ul>
<p>To richo@psych0tik.net</p>
<h2>A note about speaking</h2>
<p>Wrong Island has an "everyone pays" policy, not dissimilar from PyCon's. The
intent here is to level the playing field a bit and do away with some of the
mightier than thou aspects of a lot of hacker cons. This also has a lot to do
with the fact that as a tiny con in it's first year, we can't afford to pay for
flights or accommodation either.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to come and can't put together the money, submit a talk
and explain the situation. We can probably work something out.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether or not it's worth your time to give a talk since we're
not even going to spot you a badge, we will be finding other ways to compensate
speakers.</p>
