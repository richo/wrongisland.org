    <p>The CFP is now open!</p>
<p>We'd love to hear about your short (15-20 minute) lightning talk on something
interesting and nominally computer security related. Conceptually, we're asking
you to take your hour long talk, then throw away the 20 minutes at the start
where you try to introduce the audience to $whatever, and the 20 minutes at the
end where you try to explain why people should be terrified of your attack, and
then just be left with 20 minutes of sweet, gooey center.</p>
<p>People who want to hear more are actively encouraged to buy you a beer.</p>
<p>Please send through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle:</li>
<li>Talk Title:</li>
<li>Brief overview:</li>
<li>Bio:</li>
</ul>
<p>To richo@psych0tik.net</p>
<p>Please format your submission subject as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">WICe</span> <span class="n">CFP</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<h2>A note about speaking</h2>
<p>Wrong Island has an "everyone pays" policy, not dissimilar from PyCon's. The
intent here is to level the playing field a bit and do away with some of the
mightier than thou aspects of a lot of hacker cons. This also has a lot to do
with the fact that as a tiny con in its second year, we can't afford to pay for
flights or accommodation either.</p>
<p>That said, if you want to come (speaker or not!) and can't put together the
money, send an email explaining and we'll try to work something out.</p>
