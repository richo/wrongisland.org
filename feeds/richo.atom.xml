Thank you
all so much to the jerks that came and made it awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, a huge shoutout to &lt;a href="https://www.insomniasec.com/home"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/"&gt;great scott gadgets&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/"&gt;hackerone&lt;/a&gt; who legendarily came out of the woodwork as sponsors on the
day. On behalf of everyone who drank delicious beers and ate delicious foods,
cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm acutely aware that I still need to ship a bunch of you tshirts. Rest
assured that they sit safely in my loungeroom, waiting for my anxiety about
shipping stuff to back off. I haven't forgotten you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking forward, a bunch of people have asked me about a second Wrong Island
Con. I'm blown away by the responses, and the sheer number of offers for help
that I've had. I'm still very much in the midst of trying hard not to think
about, however plans are afoot, and there's a pretty good chance this will
happen again. More details will probably pop up here or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wrongislandcon"&gt;on
tooter&lt;/a&gt; as we get closer to my vaguely specified date.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Schedule is announced</title><link href="https://wrongisland.org/schedule-is-announced.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-05T17:50:00+11:00</updated><author><name>richo</name></author><id>tag:wrongisland.org,2014-12-05:schedule-is-announced.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;And if you click on the &lt;a href="pages/schedule.html"&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; button, you can read it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some housekeeping to go along with this post;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a few have been quick to point out, I stupidly managed to put the tickets up
in AUD instead of NZD like you would expect. As a result you've all been
charged somewhere in the ballpark of $53-$56 depending on what the exchange
rate was doing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really sorry about that! It was an honest mistake, but the only way to
fix it directly was to refund every ticket and then hassle people into rebuying
them after changing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a token of gratitude, I've thrown $5 * $badges_sold on top of what was
already going on the tab.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>speakers nearly full!</title><link href="https://wrongisland.org/speakers-nearly-full.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-19T08:44:00+11:00</updated><author><name>richo</name></author><id>tag:wrongisland.org,2014-11-19:speakers-nearly-full.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With 10 announced speakers, we're nearly full!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still room for 2 more slots, so if you're sitting on a CFP submission
you should get it to us ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The schedule will be published in the next few days. Getting some more
logistics out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accommadation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fairly cheap Rydges about a 5 minute cab ride away. Unfortunately we
didn't quality for a group rate, but you can make a booking &lt;a href="http://www.rydges.com/accommodation/new-zealand/latimer-christchurch/welcome/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afterparty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the con finishes up, there'll be a tab downstairs at the 'Hop. We hope
you'll join us for a few quiet beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last few details are firmed up in the next few days we'll be publishing
the final schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you at the con!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>First Round of Speakers</title><link href="https://wrongisland.org/first-round-of-speakers.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-31T11:44:00+11:00</updated><author><name>richo</name></author><id>tag:wrongisland.org,2014-10-31:first-round-of-speakers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we're delighted to announce our first batch of speakers.

&lt;p&gt;We'd love to have your short (15-20 minute) lightning talk on something
interesting and nominally computer security related. Leave out the context, we
want to see your One Weird Trick. Background is best discussed over beers
afterward where you can work out how much you want to frieNDA this chump in
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To richo@psych0tik.net&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also suitably convinced that this thing will happen that I'm looking for
ONE (1) ((11!1!!!)) sponsor. If this sounds interesting to you, get in touch to
discuss terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till NZ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born of a bunch of Australian infosec jerks getting sent to the Wrong Island on our pilgrimage to kiwicon 7 last year, we figured we'd probably best head intentionally to the Wrong Island for a couple of days to warm up for kiwicon proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you join us? Yes, you absolutely should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where? The Twisted Hop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;617 Ferry Road, Woolston, Christchurch 8023&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When? Monday, Dec 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? Some lightning talks. Some hanging out. Think barcon meets PoC||GTFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Stop asking questions. Come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more things about the con on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WrongIslandCon"&gt;the twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I'll put up the eventbrite thing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
